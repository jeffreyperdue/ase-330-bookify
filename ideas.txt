3 default bookshelves (Want to read, read, reading) these shelves will be automatically applied
overall book review
book notes (sticky notes) we ask the user for notes about an individual page
5 star rating system, with half star (3.5 stars)
themes (change font or just overall theme)
add progress bar based on user input of current page they are on (google books api has a pagecount attribute)
user account page can have stats like how many books they have total or in each shelf, maybe how many pages theyve read this week or total
allow users to potentially add a day finished for each book added to their shelves
let users set a book goal, like i want to read 12 books this year, and there can be a progress bar for that as well
when pressing on side nav bar genres, i think it should switch from horizontal scroll to a page that will have rows of books
search should present movies in a list with a nice size pic of the cover, short description, and maybe page count or rating?
look into letting users change their bookshelves from being front covers to the spine, maybe they can choose individual books to be front facing or spine facing
