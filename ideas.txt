-themes (change font or just overall theme)
-let users set a book goal, like i want to read 12 books this year, and there can be a progress bar for that as well
-when pressing on side nav bar genres, i think it should switch from horizontal scroll to a page that will have rows of books
-look into letting users change their bookshelves from being front covers to the spine, maybe they can choose individual books to be front facing or spine facing
-Resize/Change hero books
-Personalized recommendations



MUST DO:

Cley:
3 default bookshelves (Want to read, read, reading) these shelves will be automatically applied
add progress bar based on user input of current page they are on (google books api has a pagecount attribute)
user account page can have stats like how many books they have total or in each shelf, maybe how many pages theyve read this week or total

Jeff:
Done:
-overall book review (tied to user) X
-book notes (sticky notes) we ask the user for notes about an individual page X 
-5 star rating system, with half star (3.5 stars) (tied to user) X
-search should present movies in a list with a nice size pic of the cover, short description, and maybe page count or rating?
-Fix Author & Genre getting pulled in as unknown/unspecified X
-allow users to potentially add a day finished for each book added to their shelves X
-improve reloading performance on homepage (dynamic genres) X
-Search doesn't work from details page; from myshelf it routes to home X
-add color-coding option to notes (make them look like sticky notes) X

Todo Next:
-Implement spine-view for bookshelves
