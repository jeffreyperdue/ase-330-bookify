# 📚 Mom Test for Bookify

## 1. Setup the Session
> “We are trying to understand how people keep track of their reading and books.”

---

## 2. Structure

### Warm-up
- Quick intros: *“What are you currently reading?”*

### Past Behavior Questions
- *“Tell me about the last time you had to organize your books or reading list.”*  
- *“Have you ever lost track of what you were reading or wanted to read? What happened?”*  
- *“How do you usually decide what book to read next?”*  
- *“Where do you usually get your books — library, bookstore, online, apps?”*  
- *“What tools do you use or have used in the past?”*  

### Pain Points & Workarounds
- *“What frustrations have you encountered with existing tools?”*  
- *“Have you ever tried to share what you’re reading with someone else? How did that go?”*  
- *“If you could magically fix one problem about your reading habits or book organization, what would it be?”*  

### Wrap-Up
- Summarize: *“I noticed you mentioned…”*  
- Ask: *“Is there anything else you wish existed to help you?”*  
- Close: *“Would you like me to follow up when we have a test version so you can try it?”*

## 3. Tactics for Simultaneous “Mom Tests”
- After one answers, ask the others: *“Do you feel the same, or do you do it differently?”*  
- No pitching Bookify.  
- No *“Would you use this?”* — just uncover their reality.

## 4. What We’re Looking For
- **Patterns**: Do multiple users struggle with the same thing?  
- **Signals of commitment**: If they ask *“When can I try this?”* or *“Can I test your prototype?”*, that’s a strong outcome.
